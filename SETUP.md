## Common First Questions

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: Nope! Just open the HTML file in any browser.

**Q: Where is my API key stored?**
A: Only in YOUR browser's local storage. Never sent anywhere except OpenRouter.

**Q: How much will this cost me?**
A: About $0.08 per message. A typical game development session (50 messages) costs around $4.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: No, it needs internet to connect to OpenRouter/Claude.

**Q: What browser should I use?**
A: Any modern browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - all work great!

**Q: Can I share my API key with others?**
A: NO! Each person needs their own API key. Sharing keys = sharing costs!
